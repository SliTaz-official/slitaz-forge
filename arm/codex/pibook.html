<p>
	The Pibook is complemented by the general documentation found in the
	<a href="./.">SliTaz ARM Codex</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="install">Installation instructions</h2>

<pre class="box-up">
boot/    : Must be copied to a FAT32 partition
rootfs/  : Must be copied to an ext4 or btrfs partition
</pre>

<p>
	Be sure the SD card has got 3 partitions (boot, swap, root). The 
	recommended partition sizes are 40Mb for /boot, 420Mb for swap and
	using all available free space for root. Then you simply have to 
	run the install.sh script from the SliTaz Raspberry Pi release 
	directory:
</p>
<pre>
# ./install.sh
</pre>

<h2 id="firstboot">First boot setup</h2>

<p>
	On the first SliTaz Raspberry Pi boot you will be prompted to configure
	basic system settings such as the system keymap and the root password.
	Then you will be prompted to create the default user with its password.
</p>
<p>
	On any secure GNU/Linux system you will have to have at least the administrator
	(root) and the default human user. In this way, users can fully use
	the system but can't break it.
</p>
<p>
	You can preconfigure the system before the first boot by editing the
	configurations on the SD card and you can skip the post installation
	steps. More info on the SliTaz ARM Codex: 
	<a href="system.html#firstboot">System configs</a>
</p>

<h2 id="config">System configuration</h2>

<p>
	All SliTaz Raspberry Pi basic configurations can be done via a nice
	Ncurses driven GUI with mouse support under an X session and via
	a CGI/web administration interface. Please check the detailed 
	<a href="#remote">remote control section</a> in the book for more 
	information about the CGI/Web control panel.
</p>

<pre class="box-up">
tazberry      : Dedicated tool for all Raspberry Pi specific configs
slitaz-config : SliTaz system configs such as keymaps, lang, users
</pre>

<p>
	Tazberry and slitaz-config tool are accessible from the 'System Tools'
	menu or can be run from a cmdline:
</p>

<pre>
# tazberry
# slitaz-config
</pre>

<h2 id="audio">Audio settings</h2>

<p>
	The Raspberry Pi has two audio output modes: HDMI and headphone jack.
	You can switch between these two modes at any time. SliTaz Raspberry Pi
	provides a custom web admin plugin to graphically configure and check
	audio settings locally or remotely. The web audio control lets you 
	switch audio output and play a sound to test settings. You can directly
	access the audio control panel with a URL in the form of:
</p>
<pre>
http://192.168.x.xxx/adm/tools.cgi?audio
</pre>
<p>
	You can also configure the Raspberry Pi audio output from the command 
	line where the last number is the output mode (0=auto 1=jack 2=hdmi):
</p>
<pre>
# amxier cset numid=3 1
</pre>
<p>
	The desktop flavor includes Alsa audio mixer and mpg123 cmdline
	audio player. Please check the Codex apps page for a common list of 
	<a href="apps.html#multimedia">multimedia applications</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="update">System &amp; kernel update</h2>
<p>
	It is always a good idea to check for updates! It will bring you fixes
	and new features. With SliTaz Raspberry Pi you have to upgrade all
	the installed packages and the custom Linux Kernel. Updates can be done
	via spk-dialog and tazberry found in the "System Tools menu" or directly
	from a command line:
</p>
<pre>
# spk-dialog
# tazberry
</pre>

<h2 id="add-apps">Installing new packages</h2>

<p>
	After your system is configured and connected to the web, you may want
	to install new packages to add functionality to your SliTaz system.
	You can install new applications via spk-dialog GUI or from the command
	line with spk-add:
</p>
<pre>
# spk-add package package1 packageN
</pre>
<p>
	You can find a list of packages on the SliTaz Raspberry Pi website
	or by using the spk-find utility. You can search by package name, keyword
	or description:
</p>
<pre>
# spk-find i2c
</pre>

<h2 id="def-apps">Installed applications</h2>

<p>
	SliTaz Raspberry Pi can come in many flavors with a custom pre-installed

<h2 id="remote">GUI &amp; secure remote control</h2>

<p>
	This section will cover remote control using the SliTaz CGI/Web admin
	interface, SSH secure SHell connections and graphical desktop control
	with VNC.
</p>

<h3>CGI/Web interface</h3>

<p>
	The CGI/Web interface is a nice way to control your Raspberry Pi machine
	using Dillo from the desktop or any web browser from another computer,
	mobile or tablet device. Remote control via the CGI interface is enabled
	by default. To stop/start the service or to use another port, please refer
	to the SliTaz ARM Codex: <a href="system.html#cgi-adm">System page</a>
</p>

<p>
	SliTaz Raspberry Pi provides plugins to easily handle your Pi. In a nifty
	and clean interface you can: poweroff/reboot the system, configure boot
	settings including blacklisted modules, set audio output and test sound,
	play with GPIO pins and get I2C information, and turn on/off the green led :-)
	The tool lets you do quite a few more handy actions that you will discover
	browsing the interface.
</p>

<p>
	First you must found out the local IP address of your Raspberry Pi machine.
	On your SliTaz Pi you can use 'ipinfo' to get the IP, then connect using
	this IP. To connect you must use 'root' as user name with the correct
	system administrator password.
</p>
<pre>
$ ipinfo
</pre>

<h3>Secure SSH connection</h3>
<p>
	By default all flavors provide Dropbear Secure SHell, a lightweight but
	powerful and standard compliant SSH client and server. The server is
	not started by default, you can start it manually from the cmdline or
	edit /etc/init.d/rcS.conf to start it automatically on each boot:
</p>
<pre>
# startd dropbear
# editor /etc/rcS.conf
</pre>

<h3>VNC Desktop control</h3>
<p>
	VNC is great tool for letting you remotely control a desktop. The steps are:
	install and start the VNC server on your Pi, then install a VNC client on
	your desktop machine, mobile phone or tablet. To install the server
	and start it on your Raspberry Pi (via an SSH connection or with an
	attached keyboard and screen):
</p>
<pre>
# spk-add x11vnc
# startd x11vnc
</pre>

<h2 id="setup">Pi setup suggestions</h2>

<p>
	What can you do with your SliTaz Raspberry Pi distro? Use it as a tiny
	desktop! Learn Linux, Lua, Python, SHell scripting. Play with some
	electronics circuits, sensors, leds and Raspberry Pi pluggable boards.
	Setup servers, use the cam for fun or security purposes, create a secure
	wifi network, ...- So much can be done with a Pi! 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Kids learn about computers with Scratch and games</li>
	<li>Web server with SHell and Python CGI support</li>
	<li>Secure and anonymous wifi network with Tor</li>

	accelerated decoding on the Raspberry Pi)</li>
	<li>Video streamer with gst-omx or ffserver</li>
	<li><a href="setup.html">Codex setup guides</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="desktop">Desktop customization</h2>

<p>
	Your SliTaz Raspberry Pi Desktop can be customized to infinity! With
	a little editing of configuration files and autostart scripts you can
	configure the entire environment. The default window manager is
	JWM, but it can be replaced by OpenBox, Enlightenment (e17) or the
	DWM dynamic window manager.
</p>

<p>
	JWM autostarted applications and themes are set in a xml.jwmrc file.
	By default the system wide config is used, lets copy it to your home
	folder as a .jwmrc hidden file and then edit it:
</p>
<pre>
$ cp /etc/xdg/jwm/system.jwmrc ~/.jwmrc
$ editor .jwmrc
</pre>
<p>
	The system wide menu path is: <b>/etc/xdg/jwm/menus.jwmrc</b> and
	is updated by SliTaz packages manager. You can also copy it to
	your home folder if you want to customize it. See the official 
	<a href="http://joewing.net/projects/jwm/config.shtml">configuration documentation</a>
	for comprehensive documentation on configuring JWM.
</p>

<h3>Icon bar &amp; panel</h3>
<p>
	To have a transparent icon bar with the applications of your choice,
	you can use Wbar2. Install it and test it:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo spk-add wbar2
$ wbar
</pre>
<p>
	To have a desktop panel with Openbox you can use Tint2. Install it 
	and test it:
</p>
<pre>
$ sudo spk-add tint2
$ tint2
</pre>

<h2 id="gpio">GPIO Pins &amp; I2C Bus</h2>

<p>
	SliTaz provides all the necessary tools to work with the Raspberry Pi
	GPIO pins and I2C bus. The CGI/Web admin interface lets you control
	the GPIO pins and get I2C information. Pi I2C kernel module is
	blacklisted by default and can be loaded manually, by on-demand scripts
	or at boot by commenting the blacklist line in:
</p>
<pre class="box-up">
/etc/modprobe.d/rpi-blacklist.conf
</pre>

<p>
	To have a full working I2C bus system we must also load the 'i2c-dev'
	kernel module which is not autoloaded by udev. In this case we must
	use a SliTaz boot time configuration file, lets edit the config file
	to modify the line LOAD_MODULES to look like below:
</p>

<pre>
$ editor /etc/rcS.conf
# Kernel modules to load earlier in boot.
LOAD_MODULES="snd-bcm2835 i2c-dev"
</pre>

<h2 id="pileds">Using leds with the RPi</h2>

<p>
	Leds can be used for many purposes such as for a notification or as a light show.
	SliTaz Raspberry Pi provides a built-in utility to help set up and
	use leds. The RPi has an onboard green led (ACT) that you can 
	turn on or off:
</p>
<pre>
# pileds act
</pre>

<p>
	Pileds also provides examples and usable commands for Adafruit 7segment
	LED Backpack and the 8x8 LED Matrix. Creating visual elements with
	Kids is fun and lets them learn mathematics at the same time, since
	the leds must be mapped (ie: 0, 3) on a grid. Let's display a nice 
	little boat and pileds built in help:
</p>

<pre>
# pileds 8x8 --boat
# pileds help
</pre>

<p>
	PiLeds uses some example code from Adafruit and PiClass Git Hub 
	repositories. We have packaged them for easy install/updates and
	to provide some code right under the hood. Adafruit and PiClass
	code examples are located in:
</p>

<pre class="box-up">
/usr/share/adafruit
/usr/share/piclass
</pre>

<!-- Camera -->
<h2 id="picam">Pi Camera - Pi NoIR</h2>

<p>
	Raspberry Pi onboard camera works flawlessly with SliTaz. You can
	setup then shot, record and stream video with our easy to use and
	home made tools and the official VideoCore Tools from The Raspberry Pi
	foundation. Official documentation can be found on elinux.org wiki:
	<a href="http://elinux.org/Rpi_Camera_Module">Rpi Camera Module</a>
</p>

<p>
	To setup your camera from your Pi device, you can run TazBerry from
	the desktop menu or directly start the cam setup from a cmdline:
</p>
<pre>
# tazberry cam-setup
</pre>

<p>
	After reboot you can test the camera with <b>raspivid</b> and take a 
	picture via the CGI/Web Camera plugin. To test the camera:
</p>
<pre>
$ su -
# raspivid -d
</pre>

<h3>Pictures with Raspistill</h3>

<p>
	The official tool to take pictures with the camera board is 
	<b>raspistill</b>. The following command will take a picture
	and create the PNG image shot.png:
</p>
<pre>
# raspistill -o shot.png
</pre>

<!-- PiGlow -->
<h2 id="piglow">PiGlow from Pimorini</h2>

<p>
	PiGlow is a fun and cheap little board to learn and play with leds. It
	can do very nice effects and also supports easy on/off switches and brightness
	settings. Plug in your PiGlow board, boot your Raspberry Pi, install the Python
	PyGlow examples and utilities testsuite:
</p>

<pre>
# spk-add python-rpi-pyglow
# pyglow test
# pyglow help
</pre>

<p>
	In the package database you will also find <b>wiringpi-piglow</b>
	providing the 'piglow' utility. On the Python side, we provide some
	examples that you can use to learn and code your own scripts. Have
	a look in the folder:
</p>

<pre class="box-up">
/usr/share/pyglow
</pre>

<!-- PiFace -->
<h2 id="piface">PiFace Digital</h2>

<p>
	The PiFace Digital board allows you to connect things like switches,
	lights and motors so that your Raspberry Pi can become aware of, and  
	influence the world around it. Plug in your PiFace board then use
	SliTaz <b>piface</b> utility to install the official C library, 
	the 'pifacedigital' utility and set of tiny tools:
</p>

<pre>
# piface help
</pre>

<p>
	To test your Piface Digital board on SliTaz Raspberry Pi you simply
	have to run the testsuite from the cmdline. The tool will test GPIO 
	pins, leds and input buttons:
</p>

<pre>
# piface testsuite
</pre>

<h3>PiFace Metronome</h3>

<p>
	The Piface SliTaz utility uses WiringPi to provide a simple metronome
	using PiFace relays. The default is 80 beats per minutes but you can
	specify any beats in a range of 40 to 200. To turn on and off the
	metronome:
</p>

<pre>
# piface metronome 120
# piface metronome
</pre>

<h3>Piface Reaction game</h3>

<p>
	Let's play a reaction game with PiFace Digital. Run the command 
	below then press a button and wait until 2 LEDs are on and press 
	the corresponding button as fast as you can:
</p>

<pre>
# piface reaction
</pre>

<h3>Piface Digital info</h3>

</pre>

<!-- RaspiComm -->
<h2 id="raspicomm">RaspiComm</h2>

<p>
	RaspiComm is a pluggable board which uses advanced features like a 5-way
	joystick, two serial ports (RS-232 and RS-485), l2c output and a 
	realtime clock. The board lets you directly control a display, a stepper
	motor controller, relays and more.
</p>

<p>
	SliTaz Raspberry Pi provides a built-in tool to let you use and test
	the RaspiComm board out-of-the-box. Shutdown down your Pi if needed,
	plug in the board on to the GPIO pins and boot the system, then run the
	testsuite:
</p>

<pre>
# raspicomm init
# raspicomm testsuite
</pre>

<p>
	The testsuite will prompt you to move the Joystick left and top 
	after the LED tests. To initialize the board on each boot, setup 
	the system clock and automatically load the i2c kernel modules, you 
	need to edit the <b>local.sh</b> boot script and add a line to start 
	'raspicomm init'. This can be done in one command or by using a text
	editor:
</p>

<pre>
# echo 'raspicomm init' >> /etc/init.d/local.sh
</pre>

<p>
	The Real Time Clock uses the i2c bus. When the clock is initialized you
	can find information in: /sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-1/1-0068. On the
	first setup you need to sync the system clock from the web and then
	set the RTC from the system clock. On next reboot the system clock
	will be sync'd with the Real Time Clock:
</p>

<pre>
# rdate -s tick.greyware.com
# hwclock --systohc
</pre>

<p>
	Here is a small SHell example to turn on/off LED1. The led uses the
	gpio pin number 18. The raspicomm utility already exported the
	LED pins so we just have to set the value: 1 to turn it on and 0
	to switch it off:
</p>

<pre>
# echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio18/value
# echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio18/value
</pre>
