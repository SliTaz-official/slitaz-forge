<p>
	The Pibook is completed by the general documentation found in the
	<a href="./.">SliTaz ARM Codex</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="install">Installation instructions</h2>

<pre class="box-up">
boot/    : Must be copied to a FAT32 partition
rootfs/  : Must be copied to an ext4 or btrfs partition
</pre>

<p>
	Be sure the SD card has got 3 partitions (boot, swap, root). The 
	recommended partition sizes are 40Mb for /boot, 420Mb for swap and
	using all available free space for root. Then you simply have to 
	run the install.sh script from the SliTaz Raspberry Pi release 
	directory:
</p>
<pre>
# ./install.sh
</pre>

<h2 id="firstboot">First boot setup</h2>

<p>
	On the first SliTaz Raspberry Pi boot you will be prompted to configure
	basic system settings such as the system keymap and the root password.
	Then you will prompt to create the default user with it password.
</p>
<p>
	On any secure GNU/Linux system the will have a leat the administrator
	(root) and the default human user. In this way, users can fully use
	the system but can't break it.
</p>
<p>
	You can preconfigure the system before the first boot by editing the
	configurations on the SD card and you can skip the post installation
	steps. More info on the SliTaz ARM Codex: 
	<a href="system.html#firstboot">System configs</a>
</p>

<h2 id="config">System configuration</h2>

<p>
	All SliTaz Raspberry Pi basic configuration can be done via a nice
	Ncurses driven GUI with mouse support under an X session and via
	a CGI/web administration interface. Please check the detailed 
	<a href="#remote">remote control section</a> on the book for more 
	information about the CGI/Web control panel.
</p>

<pre class="box-up">
tazberry      : Dedicated tool for all Raspberry Pi specific configs
slitaz-config : Slitaz system configs such as keymaps, lang, users.
</pre>

<p>
	Tazberry and slitaz-config tool are accessible from the 'System Tools'
	menu or can be run from a cmdline:
</p>

<pre>
# tazberry

	and clean interface you can: poweroff/reboot the system, configure boot
	settings including blacklisted modules, set audio output and test sound,
	play with GPIO pins and get I2C information, turn on/off the green led :-)
	The tool let you do quiet a few more handy actions that you will discover
	browsinf the interface.
</p>

<p>
	You must first found out the local IP address of you Raspberry Pi machine.
	On your SliTaz Pi you can use 'ipinfo' to get the IP, then connect using
	this IP. To connect you must use 'root' as user name with the correct
	system administrator password.
</p>
<pre>
$ ipinfo
</pre>

<h3>Secure SSH connection</h3>
<p>
	By default all flavors provide Dropbear Secure SHell, a lighteight but
	powerfull and standard compliant SSH client and server. The server is
	not started by default, you van start it manually from the cmdline and
