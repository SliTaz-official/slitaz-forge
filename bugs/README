http://bugs.slitaz.org/ runs a Roundup tracker powered by a WSGI handler
(much faster than standard CGI) and Lighttpd mod_proxy

	* templates/   : Contain the SliTaz template used to install and initialize
	                 the tracker. It also have the xHTML files and CSS style.
	* roundup.wsgi : Is the WSGI handler (started at boot by the script
	                 /etc/init.d/local.sh)
	* server.ini   : Is a config that could be used with roundup-server

The bugs tracker configuration file (config.ini) is not under Hg since
it have MySQL db login information and SMTP password.
