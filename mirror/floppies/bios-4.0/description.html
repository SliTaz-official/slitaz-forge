This floppy set uses the bios instead of the linux driver. You can boot SliTaz
using unsupported floppy drives such as some pcmcia devices.

Start your computer with <i>fd001.img</i>. It will show the kernel version string and
the kernel cmdline line. You can edit the cmdline. Most users can just press Enter.

The floppy is then loaded into memory (one dot each 64k) and you will be prompted to
insert the next floppy, <i>fd002.img</i>. And so on up to <i>fd025.img</i>.
