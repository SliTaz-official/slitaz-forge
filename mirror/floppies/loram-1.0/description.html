You can start with one of the 2 following flavors :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <b>base</b> needs 20Mb of RAM and 5 floppies: <i>fd001.img</i> to <i>fd005.img</i>.<br />
  base provides the minimum slitaz distribution subset in text mode. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>core</b> needs 80M of RAM and 24 floppies: <i>fd001.img</i> to <i>fd118.img</i>.<br />
  core provides the default slitaz distribution. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Start your computer with <i>fd001.img</i>. It will show the kernel version string and
the kernel cmdline line. You can edit the cmdline. Most users can just press Enter.
</p>
<p>
The floppy is then loaded into memory (one dot each 64k) and you will be prompted to
insert the next floppy, <i>fd002.img</i>.
</p>
<p>
The loram bootstrap will then start and you will be prompted to insert extra floppies
for the core flavor. You can bypass this by using Q and Enter.
</p>
<p>
If you have an ext3 partition on your hard disk, the bootstrap can create the
installation script <u>slitaz/install.sh</u>. You will be able to install SliTaz
on your hard disk without extra media.
