You can start with one of the 4 following flavors :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <b>base</b> needs 38Mb of RAM and 6 floppies: <i>fd001.img</i> to <i>fd006.img</i>.<br />
  base provides the minimum slitaz distribution subset in text mode. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>justx</b> needs 64M of RAM and 13 floppies: <i>fd001.img</i> to <i>fd106.img</i>.<br />
  justx provides the minimum slitaz distribution subset with X11 support. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>gtkonly</b> needs 96M of RAM and 18 floppies: <i>fd001.img</i> to <i>fd204.img</i>.<br />
  gtkonly provides the minimum slitaz distribution subset with Gtk+ support. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>core</b> needs 128M of RAM and 28 floppies: <i>fd001.img</i> to <i>fd309.img</i>.<br />
  core provides the default slitaz distribution. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Start your computer with <i>fd001.img</i>. It will show the kernel version string and
the kernel cmdline line. You can edit the cmdline. Most users can just press Enter.
</p>
<p>
The floppy is then loaded into memory (one dot each 64k) and you will be prompted to
insert the next floppy, <i>fd002.img</i>. And so on up to last floppy.
</p>
<p>
You will be prompted to insert extra floppies for justx, gtkonly and core flavors.
You can bypass this by using B to boot without loading extra floppies.
