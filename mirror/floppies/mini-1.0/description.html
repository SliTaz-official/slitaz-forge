This floppy set uses the bios instead of the linux driver. You can boot SliTaz
using unsupported floppy drives such as some pcmcia devices.

The loram version of the base flavor is launched (text mode only).

Start your computer with <i>fd001.img</i>. It will show the kernel version string and
the kernel cmdline line. You can edit the cmdline. Most users can just press Enter.

<p>
The floppy is then loaded into memory (one dot each 64k) and you will be prompted to
insert the next floppy, <i>fd002.img</i>. And so on up to <i>fd005.img</i>.

<p>
If you have an ext3 partition on your hard disk, the bootstrap can create the
installation script <u>slitaz/install.sh</u>. You will be able to install SliTaz
on your hard disk without extra media.
