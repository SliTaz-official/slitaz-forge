slitaz-rolling-core-5in1.iso
    Full 32 bits desktop with gtkonly, justx and base alternatives, with 
    32 bits kernel and 64 bits Kernel.
    The default boot selects the best flavor according the RAM size. The Kernel
    is selected according the processor type.

slitaz-rolling-preinit.iso
    Used to boot special configurations such as raid, lvm... with 32 bits
    kernel and 64 bits kernel;

slitaz-rolling-core*.zip
    Full 32 bits desktop with 32 bits kernel or 64 bits kernel pre-installed 
    for DOS/Windows in the /slitaz directory. The boot instructions are in 
    /slitaz/boot/install.txt ( built from slitaz-rolling-core.iso with
