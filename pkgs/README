This is a TazPKG web interface with a search engine for packages, files,
dependencies and more.

IN THIS RELEASE
---------------

	* Use GET so we can copy past urls from a browser
	* Gettextise the search engine and use PO files
	* auto form focus
	* CSS3 style effects
	* all css now in _standard_ slitaz.css (from website) and pkgs.css
	* nice URLs to share via copying them from address bar
	* improve debug mode
	* added progress ticker while page is not complete
	* added style highlighting for the receipts

TODO
----

	* Add package page with all info and an install link
	  (tazpkg:// or tazpkg: works in Midori
	* add hint 'You are can search for depends loop, if textfield is empty'...
	* caching the footer summary
	* clear the file names, so our goal is a URL like:
	  http://pkgs.slitaz.org/?package=geany
	  (form action="$SCRIPT_NAME" -> action="/")
	* standard 4.0 has /usr/lib/slitaz/httphelper (without '.sh')
	* display dependency trees as unordered lists
