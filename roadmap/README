SliTaz Roadmap
================================================================================


SliTaz roadmap provide guide lines to the next Slitaz Stable realease. We use
our Mercurial repo to collaborate on the roadmap. All task are added and edited
in releases/[slitaz-release] and then commited to Hg. Any tasks can have a wiki
page link, description with HTML code, etc. Each release have also a goals.html
page with the summary of the goals to the next release.

All contributors are welcome to collaborate and add themself to the PEOPLE 
variable of a task. The optionnal release task Wiki should be created under
the space name en:releases:slitaz-release:task-name, example:

All the task are under SliTaz Mercurial repositories in the slitaz-forge repo.
