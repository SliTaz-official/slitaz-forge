TASK="Use XDG standards to auto start applications"

DESC="Actually we start desktop applications vis Openbox autostart.sh
script, but it's not portable and we need custom start scripts for
each WM. Using XDG standard will let us have start same applications
for all installed WM.

For LXDE I think will use LXSession and LXSession-edit. Razorqt is
standars compliant as well as XFCE. There will use files in

/etc/xdg/autostart and ~/.config/autostart

To make XDG work we also need to export some variables at session start,
and so to manage these vars and non complian WM we should have slitaz-xdg
script."
